*CESM Ensemble Consistency Test*
________________________________
This package is used to compare the results of THREE new cam tests against the
accepted ensemble.  A summary file generated by pyEc.py is needed (see README.pyEc).

This package includes:
   
       pyCECT.py            A script which compare the new cam tests against the 
                            accepted ensemble and indicates the number of principal 
			    components failures and (optionally) RMSZ scores and global means.
   
       pyEc_library.py      Library python script used by pyCECT.py


Before you start to use the package, you need to load the following modules:

       module load python
       module load numpy
       module load scipy
       module load pynio

To see all options (and defaults):
 
       python pyCECT.py -h

Notes:

	If the indir contains more than 3 files, then 3 will be chosen at random.


Examples for generating consistency results:

       (A)  Using the default pass/fail criteria (ie. sigMul, minPCFail, minRunFail, and nPC)
       	    and the summary file generated by pyEc.py:

	    -sumfile  pyEc.ens.summary.nc

	    and specifying the directory path that contains at least 3 runs:
	    
	    -indir  /glade/u/tdd/asap/verification/cesm1_3_beta11/mira
       	    
	    yields the following command:

	    python pyCECT.py --sumfile  pyEc.ens.summary.nc --indir  /glade/u/tdd/asap/verification/cesm1_3_beta11/mira
